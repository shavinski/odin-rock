# odin-rock
Project rock paper scissors, 2-3 weeks into the javascript portion of fundamentals.

First day I spent trying to figure out the fucntion of getComputerChoice.
Then spent the next few days pracitcing and making functions, if statements etc. because I was stuck on how to do a playRound funciton.

On 8/18/22 spent half of the time trying to make my own function but was finding no success. I began to look up solutions online 
and found a solution that made sense.  

Finished on 8/19/22 added a game, and getPlayerChoice function and got rid of checkWinner function

1/12/23
Back working with the odin project after interviewing for bootcamps and getting into Rithm School. Relearned git commands in terminal, relearned html and css since I have not used in a long time. Added a css style sheet were I designed the website. Started working on re coding my javascript to work on DOM manipulation. Able to update player choice and computer choice mystery boxes with updated images. Next time will need to work on scoring and ending the game with a score of >5.
