Project rock paper scissors, 2-3 weeks into the javascript portion of fundamentals.

First day I spent trying to figure out the fucntion of getComputerChoice.
Then spent the next few days pracitcing and making functions, if statements etc. because I was stuck on how to do a playRound funciton.

On 8/18 spent half of the time trying to make my own function but was finding no success. I began to look up solutions online 
and found a solution that made sense.  

Finished on 8/19 added a game, and getPlayerChoice function and got rid of checkWinner function
